An efficient classifier \\nshould have higher values for these indicators.  To facilitate the \\ninterpretation  of the algorithm performance, Van Rijsberjen, \\n(1979)  [21] has created a synthetic measure  F1-Measure  or F-\\nscore , defined as  the harmonic mean of the precision ( True \\nPositive Accuracy ) and recall  (True Positive Rate)  of a binary \\ndecision rule . The F -measure recognized as the most \\ncommonly used measure to assess test ’s accuracy, applied to \\nstatistical analysis, machine learning, natural language \\nprocessing and information retrie val. \\n𝐹−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 = ((1+𝛽2)×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 )\\n((𝛽2×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 )+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ) \\n 𝛽2=1 \\nNevertheless, according to research of (Nakache and \\nMetais, 2005)  [22], the F -Measure has certain shortcoming s, \\nthey introduce a meta -measure \"K -Measure\" which is an \\noverall of F -measure and break even p oint ( Joachims, 1998)  \\n[23].  \\n𝐾−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 =(1+𝛽2 )×(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 )𝛼\\n((𝛽2×𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 )+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 ) \\n 𝛽2=1,𝛼=0,5 \\nThus, we will integrate the two measures in our study to   \\nevaluate the relevance of the algorithms and proceed to \\nclassify them according to the outcome of each measure \\nseparately.  \\nTo support the results of our study between the two \\nmeasures mentioned, we introduce another indicator  : Root \\nMean Squared Log error (RMSE) (also called the root mean \\nsquare deviation, RMSD) is commonly  used  to calculate \\nsquare difference between the prediction and target for each \\npoint, then ave rage those values into the root (Bouthevillain  \\nand Mathis, 1995 ) [24].

WEKA is an acronym for Waikato Env ironment for \\nKnowledge Analysis , developed at the University of Waikato \\nin New Zealand . It is  open -source  programming library \\nwritten in  Java with wide support  for machine \\nlearning  algorithms , able to solve a wide variety of automatic training tasks, such as data preprocessing, clustering , \\nclassification, regression and implementation.  \\n2) Experimental results  \\n \\nIn this paper , we have proposed a  comparative analysis  \\nbetween the different classification models according to the \\ntwo performance measures F -Measure and K -Measure. T he \\nRMSE indicator will also be calculated and compared with the \\nresult of the two measures; In the “Features Selection ” \\nSection , we reduced the  number of features  from 26 to 19 to \\nkeep only the relevant features . As presented in Table 2 , \\nbefore reduction we can see that Adaboost.M1 shows the best \\nclassification score  (96.68%) using  K-Measure, but Decision  \\nTable takes the lead ( 24.7%) using F -Measure.   \\nHowever, after reducing the features , the results of F -\\nMeasure and K -measure are v isibly improved  as shown in \\nTable 3 . According to K -Measure, Random Forest keeps the \\nbest s core with 99.4% (+4%). U nlike F -Measure, Decision \\nTable keeps almost the same score 24.7% and gives up the \\nfirst place to MultilayerPerceptron with 25.6 % (+1.2%).  \\nAdmittedly, the two rankings are different or even \\nopposite, indeed RandomForest is ranked last with F -\\nMeasure, whereas  it is ranked first with K -Measure. In order \\nto judge the relevance of the two measures, we introduced the \\nRMSE indicator , as presented in Fig.2,  the result obtained \\nshows a strong rank correlation between K-measure and'),\n",

Radom Forest also has the best ratio \\nbetween recall and precision , the share of fraud disco vered \\namong all frauds is 23.8%. O n the other hand, we have the \\nprecision  is 19.7%  holding the highest score between models , \\nthis means that in 2/10 of the cases when a claim is predicted  \\nas fraud, the model is correct . Furthermore , if we compare \\naccuracy  value  with the result found by the previous \\nresearches mentioned in Table 1, we have earned the highest \\nscore with 89. 57 at tributed to Random Forest.  Moreover , we \\ncan also conclude that the performance evaluation method for \\na classificati on model based on the (Van Rijsberjen, 1979)  \\napproach using its F -Measure formula is outdated, the method \\nshould be upgraded or replaced with  the (Nakache & Metas, \\n2005)  approach.  \\nIn real life, accusing an insured of fraud is a grave act, the \\nclient risks not being indemnified for a probability of a claim \\nsuspected fraudulent , such probability depending on the result \\nand performance of the classification model chosen . \\nRandomForest has the best score in our case study, but the \\ninsurance companies are more prudent,  as they can only open \\na litigation process for the piece of evidence  and not on a \\nprobability basis . Otherwise, this can compromise the \\ninsurer\\'s image and reputation, or even generate other indirect \\ncosts.  \\nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \\n \\nThis project has received funding from the European \\nUnion’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme \\nunder the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreemen t No \\n777720.  \\nREFERENCES  \\n \\n[1] Richard J.
